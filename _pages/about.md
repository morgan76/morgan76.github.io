Hello! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at CNRS in Nantes, working with [Dr. Vincent Lostanlen](https://lostanlen.com/) on **Multi-Resolution Neural Networks (MuReNN)** for audio. I completed my PhD at the [ADASP Group](https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr/) at Télécom Paris, where I was jointly supervised by [Prof. Slim Essid](https://slimessid.github.io/research/) and [Brian McFee](https://brianmcfee.net/) from New York University.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and audio data analysis, with a particular focus on Music Information Retrieval (MIR).

### Academic Journey

- **2014–2019**: I earned a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rouen, France.
- **Summer 2017**: I was a research intern in the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA. I worked on audio-to-score alignment for live music performances under the supervision of Prof. [Roger Dannenberg](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/).
- **2018–2019**: I was a graduate exchange student at École Polytechnique de Montréal, Canada.
- **2020–2021**: I completed the master’s program in Sound & Music Computing at the [Music Technology Group (MTG)](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/) at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.
- **2021–2024**: I was a doctoral researcher at the Audio Data Analysis and Signal Processing Group at Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). My doctoral research focused on Music Structure Analysis. You can access my thesis manuscript [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04980794/).
- **Summer 2025**: I completed a research internship at Spotify, supervised by [Dr. Rachel Bittner](https://rachelbittner.github.io/), where I worked on **music summarization**.
