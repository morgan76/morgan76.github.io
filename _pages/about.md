I am a PhD student within the <a href='https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr/'>ADASP Group</a> at Télécom Paris under the joint supervision of Prof. <a href='https://slimessid.github.io/research/'>Slim Essid</a> and <a href='https://brianmcfee.net/'>Brian McFee</a> from New York University. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing and audio data analysis with an emphasis on Music Information Retrieval (MIR).

In 2019, I obtained a master’s degree in applied mathematics (diplôme d’ingénieur) from Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rouen, France. I then completed the master’s program in Sound & Music Computing within the Music Technology Group <a href='https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/'>(MTG)</a> at Pompeu Fabra university in Barcelona, Spain. Since 2021, I am part of the Audio Data Analysis and Signal Processing research group at Télécom Paris where I’m pursuing a doctoral degree on the problem of Music Structure Analysis.
