Hello! I'm a recent PhD graduate from the [ADASP Group](https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr/) at Télécom Paris. I was jointly supervised by [Prof. Slim Essid](https://slimessid.github.io/research/) and [Brian McFee](https://brianmcfee.net/) from New York University.

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and audio data analysis, with a particular focus on Music Information Retrieval (MIR).

### Academic Journey

- **2014-2019**: I earned a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rouen, France.
- **2020-2021**: I completed the master’s program in Sound & Music Computing at the [Music Technology Group (MTG)](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/) at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.
- **2021-2024**: I was a doctoral researcher at the Audio Data Analysis and Signal Processing Group at Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). My doctoral research focused on Music Structure Analysis. You can access my thesis manuscript [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04980794/).

### Research Focus

Estimating song structures is a crucial task in Music Information Retrieval, yet it presents challenges due to the ambiguity of structure annotations and the scarcity of labeled data. My PhD research addressed these issues through three main approaches:

1. **Self-supervised Learning for Music Segmentation**: I developed innovative methods that leverage prior musical knowledge, such as the hierarchical nature of music structure, to learn audio representations. These methods enhance segmentation performance without the need for labeled data.

2. **Graph-based Music Structure Analysis**: By framing music structure analysis as a link prediction task, I applied deep graph learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation results with minimal labeled data, improving both performance and interpretability.

3. **Multimodal Learning with Language Models**: I explored the connection between text and audio, utilizing language models to tackle ambiguities in music structure annotations.

### What's Next?

This summer, I am excited to be doing a research internship at Spotify, under the supervision of Dr. Rachel Bittner.

I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in both academic and industrial sectors. If you're interested in my work or have potential opportunities, I'd love to connect!
